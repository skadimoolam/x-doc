## x-doc Documentation

x-dox is a tiny node CLI app to browse the official Node Documentation.

### Install
 > npm install x-doc

 This should install the CLI app.

### Usage
 Using it is as simple as typing

 >x-doc fs.readFileSync

 >x-doc http

### Please Note
All the current docs are based on IOjs and not NodeJS, but this will be soon fixed.
This is in very early stages of Development, expect it to be a little quirky. Please file bugs when you find them.

And all Contribution are appreciated.
